## Overview
This application allows students to:
- Input the number of subjects they have taken in a semester.
- Enter the credits for each subject.
- Select the grade they received in each subject.
- Calculate the SGPA based on the inputs.

## SGPA Formula
The SGPA (Semester Grade Point Average) is calculated using the following formula:

  SGPA = (Sum of (Credits Ã— Grade Points)) / (Sum of Credits)

### Explanation
1. **Credits:** The number of credits for a subject.
2. **Grade Points:** The numerical equivalent of the grade (e.g., 'O' = 10, 'A+' = 9).
3. The sum of the product of credits and grade points for all subjects is divided by the total number of credits.

### Example
Suppose a student has the following grades and credits:

| Subject    | Credits | Grade | Grade Points |
|------------|---------|-------|--------------|
| Math       | 4       | A+    | 9            |
| Physics    | 3       | O     | 10           |
| Chemistry  | 2       | B+    | 7            |

**SGPA Calculation:**

\[
\text{Total Credit Points} = (4 \times 9) + (3 \times 10) + (2 \times 7) = 36 + 30 + 14 = 80
\]

\[
\text{Total Credits} = 4 + 3 + 2 = 9
\]

\[
\text{SGPA} = \frac{80}{9} \approx 8.89
\]

## Features
- Input subject names and credits.
- Select grades for each subject.
- Dynamic SGPA calculation.
- Simple and intuitive user interface.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/chuadharysagar/Sgpa-Cgpa_calculator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Sgpa-Cgpa_calculator
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
5. Open your browser and navigate to:
    ```
    http://localhost:3000
    ```

## Usage
1. Enter the subject name (optional).
2. Select the number of subjects and their respective grades.
3. The application will use the `gradeMap` context to assign grade points based on the selected grades.
4. The "Calculate SGPA" button will compute the SGPA and display the result.

## Technologies Used
- **React**: For building the user interface.
- **Context API**: For managing the state of grade mappings.
- **JavaScript**: Logic and calculations.
- **CSS**: Styling the components.
